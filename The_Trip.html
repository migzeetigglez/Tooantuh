        <p>Diamonds. Come on down tomorrow morning</p>
        <p>at 10am to learn all about diamonds.</p>
        <p>THE 4 Cs! And be the first to know WHEN. AND.</p>

        <p>slack, through the promenade, Studio B, the</p>
        <p>Solarium, and the Casino in search of the</p>

        <p>Hello, Cozumel</p>

        <p>Hola, Mayan ruins</p>
        <p>There are monkeys in the trees. A man leans over</p>
        <p>"They're all assholes"</p>
        <p>We have to go. Everyone runs back to the bus</p>

        <p>"Without this hull, I would murder you."</p>
        <br>
        <p>It's been two and quarter year since I held a cigarette to my lips and</p>
        <p>inhaled its jet fuel. On this ship, I feel most at home with those that regularly</p>
        <p>suck their most toxic selves into their lungs to quiet the invisible vibrations.</p>
        <p>So, here we are. On desk 4. As close as we can be to the Ocean's fingers as it</p>
        <p>scales its way up the bow before retreating back into itself, over and over and</p>
        <p>over again and again, amidst clouds of mist and smoke. "I'm happy here."</p>

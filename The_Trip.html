    <h1>7 days at sea</h1>
    <h3>In November of 2017, Andrea and I boarded a Royal Caribbean Cruisline in seek of adventure</h3>
    <h3>What started out as a charming jaunt into the deep blue expanse, soon transformed into a rudderless descent into mania.</h3>
    <h3>I wrote my musings as I fell into the troughs and rose with the peaks</h3>

        <p>There are monkeys in the trees. A man leans over</p>

        <p>It's been two and quarter year since I held a cigarette to my lips and</p>
        <p>inhaled its jet fuel. On this ship, I feel most at home with those that regularly</p>
        <p>suck their most toxic selves into their lungs to quiet the invisible vibrations.</p>
        <p>So, here we are. On desk 4. As close as we can be to the Ocean's fingers as it</p>
        <p>scales its way up the bow before retreating back into itself, over and over and</p>
        <p>over again and again, amidst clouds of mist and smoke. "I'm happy here."</p>

    <br>
    <p>We've embarked</p>
    <br>
    <p>"Diamonds. Diamonds. Diamonds. Diamonds.</p>
    <p>Pink button down and blazer. Balding. Maybe</p>
    <p>40. Oh, and Diamonds. "Diamonds. Diamonds.</p>
    <p>Diamonds. Come on down tomorrow morning</p>
    <p>at 10am to learn all about diamonds.</p>
    <p>THE 4 Cs! And be the first to know WHEN. AND.</p>
    <p>where you'll find the BEST of the BEST deals</p>
    <p>for the duration of your cruise! The first 200 in</p>
    <p>line will receive special deals and, of course,</p>
    <p>an exlusive voucher to be used during your</p>
    <p>stay on our luxurious vessel." Slick, endless</p>
    <p>onyx bars the width of redwoods puncture the</p>
    <p>Ocean's surface and shoot skyward, encircling</p>
    <p>the gigantic vessel. "Diamonds. Diamonds."</p>
    <p>Diamonds. Diamonds. DIAMONDS.</p>
    <P>DIAMONDS. DIAMONDS. DIAMONDS." The</P>
    <p>geriatrics stomp in rhythm towards the aft of</p>
    <p>the ship, heads back, eyes wide and jaws</p>
    <p>slack, through the promenade, Studio B, the</p>
    <p>Solarium, and the Casino in search of the</p>
    <p>source of the mantra</p>
    <br>
    <p>And I witnessed the watering down of spirits</p>
    <br>
    <p>Does an ambitious real estate developer gape at</p>
    <p>the deep blue expance and see opportunity?</p>
    <br>
    <p>Hello, Cozumel</p>
    <p>Hello, Playa del Carmen</p>
    <p>Hola, Mayan ruins</p>
    <p>There are monkeys in the trees. A man leans over</p>
    <p>"They're all assholes"</p>
    <p>We have to go. Everyone runs back to the bus</p>
    <p>"Don't mix the tips.</p>
    <p>You don't want a 2nd Mexican Revolution."</p>
    <br>
    <p>On a Sea Odyssey reading a Space Odyssey.</p>
    <br>
    <p>“*¡crash!* *¡hisss!*”</p>
    <p>Who's there?</p>
    <p>"Ocean"</p>
    <p>'Ocean' who?</p>
    <p>"Without this hull, I'd murder you."</p>
    <br>
    <p>It's been two and quarter year since I held a cigarette to my lips and</p>
    <p>inhaled its jet fuel. On this ship, I feel most at home with those that regularly</p>
    <p>suck their most toxic selves into their lungs to quiet the invisible vibrations.</p>
    <p>So, here we are. On desk 4. As close as we can be to the Ocean's fingers as it</p>
    <p>scales its way up the bow before retreating back into itself, over and over and</p>
    <p>over again and again, amidst clouds of mist and smoke. "I'm happy here."</p>
    <br>
    <p>Dear inventors, artists, creators of all kinds, and, most especially: parents</p>
    <p>"The Great Bird will take its flight on the back of the Great Bird, bringing glory</p>
    <p>to the nest where it was born." - da Vinci</p>

    <p>It waits.</p>
    <br>
    <p>As we near, the sea is swallowing the land, each white cap the tip of a tooth</p> 
    <p>sprouting from an unfathomable breadth of blue.</p>
    <p>in Time.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Grand Cayman, the set.</p>
    <p>Grand Cayman, the stage.</p>
    <p>Grand Cayman,</p>
    <p>the Grand Production.</p>
    <p>Blue water and shit trinkets.</p>
    <br>
    <p>It tastes you It rejects you</p>
    <br>
    <p>Show’s over.</p>
    <p>Back to the boatel.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I glue my glasses back together, and</p>
    <br>
    <p>The boat is trembling. I thought it was me this whole time and make a wish.</p>
    <p>Somewhere between Grand Cayman and Falmouth, Jamaica — HELP</p>
    <br>
    <p>A man smiles, and his teeth jump out. They sing Unchained Melody</p>
    <br>
    <p>If a message was sent to the nearest rescue port, how long would it be before we human jettison were retrieved from the maw of the amorphous, ancient glutton?
    <p>Too long, and it is too eager</p>
    <p>A throat 4,980 meters deep.</p>
    <p>We’re sailing on a serial murderer in its own backyard.</p>
    <br>
    <p>901-18, Movistar,</p>
    <p>901-18, DIGICEL,</p>
    <p>901-18, Movistar</p>
    <p>No connection</p>
    <p>Fuck it. I'll try again from the moon.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I'm going to die.</p>
    <p>I want to see it coming.</p>
    <p>The halls are made of cigarettes.</p>
    <p>The walls cough clouds of smoke.</p>
    <p>These carpets. These rugs.</p>
    <p>The elevator is an antique collector's million-year-old-humidor.</p>
    <p>I make it outside with 3 lumps on my right lung. Deck 4 has been settled by flint stones and fireflies and the whites of red-hued eyes.</p>
    <p>We wait until -</p>
    <br>
    <p>GOOD MORNING!</p>

    <br>
    <p>Jamaica</p>
    <br>
    <p>There's a little Blue Church roughly 40 Jesus-on-the-crosses from the</p>
    <p>Red Stripe Brewery</p>
    <br>
    <p>On Sunday,</p>
    <p>The men go to the bar.</p>
    <p>The women go to the church.</p>
    <p>They both go home with the Holy Spirit.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Runaway Bay, 1831 - "Meet me at Ocho Rios" she says. "You know the</p>
    <p>place" she says as they step into their tears and disappear into fibrous dark.</p>
    <p>The lords of chains overhear, and the search for the mouth of the 8 rivers</p>
    <p>unfolds.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Time-lapse - 186 years - the young woman guides our group across her</p>
    <p>island. We form a web of arms, legs, nubs, fingers, hair, teeth and begin to</p>
    <p>ohm in unison. The ohm is a vessel, and within its oscillating chambers one</p>
    <p>can hear "Seize the means of production!"</p>
    <br>
    <p>It is believed emancipation is won as Coin-Operated Robo-Jesus soars through the low-hanging clouds.</p>
    <br>
    <p>"SEIZE THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION!" We're screaming now as we swipe our cards</p>
    <p>and struggle with gift bags.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I buy a fucking dashiki.</p>
    <br>
    <p>1,200 meters up, an '89 Civic piloted by the Jamiacan Mario Andretti decides</p>
    <p>to pass a tail of haulers around a bend. In his final moment of triumph he</p>
    <p>evades an 18-wheeled guillotine and breaks through the guard rail between the </p>
    <p>asphalt - and - sky</p>
    <p>"In Jamiaca, we have no problems, only situations, and situations can be dealt with."</p>
    <p>R I P</p>
    <p>f i n a l l y  f r e e</p>
    <br>
    <p>Two cigars, pls.</p>
    <p>"Oh, do you smoke, baby?"</p>
    <p>No, my dad does.</p>
    <p>"In Jamaica Christians don't smoke! A good Christian boy then?"</p>
    <p>No.</p>
    <p>"Oh."</p>
    <br>
    <p>Bye, Patrice.</p>
    <p>Hell-OH GOD, NO!</p>
    <br>
    <p>It is Dawn of the Dead</p>
    <p>only the mall is this floating QVC ad, and the zombies are boomers and their spawns</p>
    <br>
    <p>The island moans.</p>
    <br>
    <p>We board and slither out to sea.</p>

    <br>
    <p>There's an elephant in my cabin</p>
    <br>
    <p>Are they putting lopramide in the food?</p>
    <br>
    <p>There's a rabbit in my cabin.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The septic system is sentient. It pens a letter to the cooks.</p>
    <p>"Bless you" it says.</p>
    <p>There are tears on the envelope. They're still wet.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I've left the toilet, and there's a monkey in my cabin. I back into the elevator</p>
    <p>and rise to deck 11 with</p>
    <br>
    <p>5,000 costive passengers. Our distended abdomens  are flotillas.</p>
    <p>"Alpha Alpha Alpha. Deck 11. Starboard side."</p>
    <p>"Alpha Alpha Alpha. Deck 11. Starboard side."</p>
    <p>An 87-year-old retired phlemotomist falls over.</p>
    <p>So does the ship,</p>
    <p>and we flesh roll out like lumps of potato bread.</p>
    <p>He bobs on the surface towards the horizon, turns his head and says,</p>
    <br>
    <p>"The ocean has claimed more sentient life than anything else in the history of</p>
    <p>this planet." We all nod in agreement and wave goodbye</p>
    <p>He is never seen again.</p>
    <br>
    <p>A capable military of ancient women guard the slot machines. The casino is a</p>
    <p>mine field.</p>
    <p>It's not safe anywhere.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Jar Jar is in my cabin...</p>
    <p>What the fu.... WHO is doing this?!</p>
    <br>
    <p>R O Y</p>
    <p>we didn't ask for this.</p>
    <br>
    <p>It's 2:31am - 5 hours 'til dock.</p>
    <p>The Gulf is livid</p>
    <p>lashing at the liner with its rolling waves and winds, while every atom of its</p>
    <p>mass groans in collective agony.</p>
    <br>
    <p>"Have you ever detoxed off of God?"</p>
    <br>
    <p>Deck 4</p>
    <p>An aggrieved man steps out to have a smoke. He manages to light an</p>
    <p>American Spirit just before being lifted up by a pair of twin-winds into the</p>
    <p>doldrums. He lands in Galveston just before his last drag and waits impatiently</p>
    <p>for his luggage to arrive.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The earth rocks beneath his feet.</p>
    <p>He lights another.</p>
